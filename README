The webpage and keep-alive batch script needed to turn a Windows machine
into an Internet Explorer kiosk.

Files:
 * INSTALL
	A text file describing how to install this package onto a computer.
 * README
	This file.  (META!)
 * KeepIEOpen.bat
	Main script that launches Internet Explorer and restarts it
	whenever it closes.
 * KeepIEOpen_HideScript.bat
	Runs the main script but hides it from showing up in the task bar.
 * KillIE.bat
	Simply kills all running instances of Internet Explorer.  If the
	KeepIEOpen.bat script is running, Internet Explorer should restart
	automatically.
 * Update.bat
	Invokes 'git' to check the internet for changes to this repository
	and automatically updates this repository, assuming there are no
	conflicts.
 * ResetCycle.bat
	Simply runs Update.bat and KillIE.bat serially.  Run this script
	as a Windows Scheduled Task when the computer is idle to update
	and reset the kiosk.
 * KioskHome.html
	The default home page of Internet Explorer when used for this
	kiosk mode.  This page just contains links to Student Email and
	Leyburn Library's home page.
